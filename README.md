# AI-Assisted Complaint & Component Identification System

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an AI-assisted decision-support system designed to help operational teams identify potentially relevant components during product complaint handling.

The system does not automate decisions. Instead, it uses AI to eliminate incorrect component paths and provide structured reasoning, while keeping the final responsibility fully in human hands.

Google Sheets serves as the single source of truth for orders, deliveries, components, and complaints, while Zapier orchestrates the end-to-end process.

## Business Problem
In many operational environments, product complaints require fast identification of the correct replacement component.

Incomplete information, fragmented data sources, and time pressure often lead to incorrect component selection. This results in unnecessary logistics costs, extended resolution times, and repeated service cycles.

The problem is not a lack of data, but the lack of structured decision support that helps eliminate incorrect options before a final human decision is made.
