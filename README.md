# AI-Assisted Complaint & Component Identification System

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an AI-assisted decision-support system designed to help operational teams identify potentially relevant components during product complaint handling.

The system does not automate decisions. Instead, it uses AI to eliminate incorrect component paths and provide structured reasoning, while keeping the final responsibility fully in human hands.

Google Sheets serves as the single source of truth for orders, deliveries, components, and complaints, while Zapier orchestrates the end-to-end process.
