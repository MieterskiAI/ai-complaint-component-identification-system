# Pilot KPIs (and how to measure)

Use these metrics to evaluate impact without claiming results in advance.

## Recommended KPIs
- **Incorrect dispatch rate**
  - Measure: incorrect component shipments / total shipments.
  - Compare: baseline (pre-pilot) vs. pilot period.

- **Time to decision**
  - Measure: time from complaint creation to final decision.
  - Compare: median time pre-pilot vs. pilot.

- **Repeat shipment rate**
  - Measure: repeat shipments within 30 days / total shipments.
  - Compare: baseline vs. pilot.

- **Operator confidence score**
  - Measure: 1–5 rating collected after each decision.
  - Compare: average score pre-pilot vs. pilot.

## Data collection notes
- Ensure timestamps are stored consistently in the complaint system.
- Log AI suggestions and final decisions for auditability.
- Keep the pilot window fixed (e.g., 4–6 weeks) for clean comparison.
